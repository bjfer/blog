The usual first post, just testing that everything works fine.

It did after a couple of tries ;-) I am using the [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/][Poison theme]] and at first I has having problems with my profile picture and my about page not being properly displayed. Adding this line to my =hugo.toml= did the trick:

#+begin_src
  canonifyurls=true
#+end_src
