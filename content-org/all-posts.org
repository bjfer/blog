The usual first post, just testing that everything works fine.

It did after a couple of tries ;-) I am using the [[https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/][Poison theme]] and at first I has having problems with my profile picture and my about page not being properly displayed. Adding this line to my =hugo.toml= did the trick:

#+begin_src
  canonifyurls=true
#+end_src

* DONE A Git pre-commit hook for VHDL projects                     :git:vhdl:

For a while, I have been considering doing a series of Youtube videos inspired by the awesome series from Rainer KÃ¶nig about [[https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVtKhBrRV_ZkPnBtt_TD1Cs9PJlU0IIdE&feature=shared][Org Mode]], just to show how Emacs is the best free VHDL editor. Far too often, I see experienced HDL developers using the default editor provided by the FPGA vendor tools. You don't need to dive deep into Emacs to take full advantage of the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/vhdl-mode.html][VHDL mode]] available in the editor.

As an incentive, here is the git pre-commit hook I use in most of my VHDL projects. The hook does two things:

- checks if there are new HDL sources that have not been added to the repository
- for all modified HDL sources, use Emacs in batch mode to align the code and remove unnecessary whitespace


The most common whitespace I add is trailing and extra blank lines. Emacs has a straightforward command to delete the former, =delete-trailing-whitespace=, and using a =replace-regexp=, I can substitute multiple blank lines for just one. Aligning VHDL code is done with the =vhdl-beautify-buffer= command.

The prerequisite to running this hook is to have a single folder that contains all your HDL sources (subfolders are allowed). In most of my HDL projects, that folder is /sources/hdl./ I also configure my /.gitignore/ file to ignore all other sources in that folder, like this:

#+begin_src shell
  !sources/hdl/*.vhd
  !sources/hdl/**/*.vhd
#+end_src

My pre-commit hook is below:

#+begin_src sh
  #!/bin/sh
  hdl_folder="sources/hdl"

  # Check if there are hdl files which are not commited
  untracked_hdl_files=`git ls-files -o --exclude-standard ${hdl_folder}`

  if ! [ -z $untracked_hdl_files ]; then
      echo "There are uncommited vhd files in ${hdl_folder}! Remove or add then!"
      echo "Files uncommited:"
      echo "$untracked_hdl_files"
      exit 1
  fi

  # If Emacs is available, this command will apply:
  # - delete all trailing whitespace
  # - run vhdl-beautify-buffer to all hdl sources
  # - replace multiple empty lines with a single one

  if command -v emacs &> /dev/null; then
      # Check only hdl files that have changed
      hdl_files=`git diff --name-only HEAD ${hdl_folder}`
      for i in $hdl_files; do
	  emacs -batch $i --eval '(progn (delete-trailing-whitespace) (vhdl-beautify-buffer) (replace-regexp "^\n+" "\n"))' -f save-buffer \
		# send all messages to trash
		2> /dev/null
      done
      # Add modified files
      git add $hdl_files
  fi
#+end_src
