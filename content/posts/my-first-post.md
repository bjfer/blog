The usual first post, just testing that everything works fine.

It did after a couple of tries ;-) I am using the [Poison theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/) and at first I has having problems with my profile picture and my about page not being properly displayed. Adding this line to my `hugo.toml` did the trick:

```nil
canonifyurls=true
```
