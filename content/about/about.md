Hi! My name is Bruno Fernandes and welcome to my little online notepad,
where I make unscheduled posts on how I use software tools in my daily
work.

I am currently working in the [European XFEL](https://www.xfel.eu/) as
the Leader of the **Fast Electronics Team**, part of the Electronics
and Electrical Engineering Group. My team is responsible for
integration, maintenance, firmware development and setup of hardware platforms
for data acquisition and processing. Our main experience is with [MicroTCA platforms](https://www.picmg.org/openstandards/microtca/). 

Besides leading and (hopefully) inspiring my Team to reach for the
highest goals, my development work is focus on FPGA platforms. On a
daily basis I am messing around with HDLs, HLS or Simulink, C/C++ for
embedded code and TCL, Bash and Python for scripting. 

I rely on Org mode for organizing, tracking and documenting my work.
Whatever I am doing, you can safely bet I am doing it in Emacs.

This blog is written using [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/), uses the [Poison Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/poison/) and is published using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
